# Locale
If your locale is supported by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleString" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">`.toLocaleString()`</a> is enough to pass it to `settings.lang`.

<Sandbox example="internationalization-locale" />

If the locale is not supported or is translated incorrectly, you can always set the locale manually, see the next section.
