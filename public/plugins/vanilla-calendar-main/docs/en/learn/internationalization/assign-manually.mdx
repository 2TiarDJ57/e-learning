# Assign manually
In order not to deprive or offend anyone, the possibility of manual localization has been added to the calendar, in case the `settings.lang` parameter does not suit you for some reason.

In general, only the inscriptions of months and weeks are localized in the calendar, so it is enough to pass the appropriate arrays of strings, and set the value of `'settings.lang` to `'define'`.

<Info>
  Note that the week array must start with Sunday, this does not affect **ISO 8601**.
