# Click on the week number

In some countries it is customary to designate dates using week numbers. To do this, the `settings.visibility.weekNumbers` parameter has been added to the calendar, which is responsible for their display.

But now we will try not only to display week numbers, but also to get some data by clicking on the number.

Having information about the dates in this week, we can select these dates by writing a couple of lines of code.
