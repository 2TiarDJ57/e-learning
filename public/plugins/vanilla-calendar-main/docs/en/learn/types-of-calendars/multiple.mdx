# Multiple

The `'multiple'` calendar type displays multiple months, allows you to select days, switch between months using the arrows, but disables the ability to select the month and year from the corresponding headings.

This calendar type is most commonly used in conjunction with the `settings.selection.day: 'multiple-ranged'` option, which allows you to select a range of dates.
Let's also turn off past days and hide days from other months.
