# DOM templates

One of the advantages of this calendar is that you can easily customize its HTML markup with the `DOMTemplates` parameter.

Thanks to this, you can safely add your button or any other html element to your calendar.

`DOMTemplates` takes the `type` of a calendar as a key. And types take a string as a value.

In the example below, we'll customize the title of our calendar, but only for `type: 'default'` and add a regular button.
