# Themes

The calendar supports dark and light themes.

If for the `settings.visibility.themeDetect`. set to `false`, the theme is determined by the user's system or `settings.visibility.theme`.

The calendar can detect and track the theme of the site automatically, by the given tag and attribute, read more in the reference, the parameter <a href="/docs/reference/additionally/settings#visibility-themeDetect">`settings.visibility.themeDetect`</a>.

If your site only supports one theme, or if you want your calendar to look different, you can force any of the themes.

By the way, since we're forcing one theme on, we don't need to load an extra css file.

Remove extra css import and activate dark theme.

<Sandbox example="customization-and-modification-themes-dark" themeDetection={false} />

And now the same thing, only with the `'light'` theme.

<Sandbox example="customization-and-modification-themes-light" themeDetection={false} />
