# Start and end dates of existing dates

It is important to know that the date range in the calendar can be set in two ways, now we will talk about the first way `date.min` and `date.max`. These two parameters indicate the valid range of dates in the calendar.

The default minimum date is `'1970-01-01'`, the start day of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">UNIX time</a>.

The default maximum date is `'2470-12-31'` - this date has no symbolic meaning, I just made it up. ðŸ™‚

Replace the values â€‹â€‹with your dates if that's important to you. But remember that dates outside the specified range are **not processed by the calendar**.
