# Actions

Actions are calendar handlers, they allow you to get the necessary data for further processing.

<Info>
  Note that month numbers start at `0`, so December is the 11th month.
  This is due to the work of the standard method <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getMonth" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer" >`.getMonth()`</a>.

## actions.clickDay()

`Type: Function`

`Default: null`

`Options: clickDay(e, dates) => void | null`

```js
new VanillaCalendar('#calendar', {
  actions: {
    clickDay(e, dates) {},
  },
});
```

The method is triggered after clicking on a day in the calendar. Parameters that can be received: `e` - mouse event, `dates` - array of selected dates.

<Info>
  It is important to know that each HTML element of the day that is clicked contains a data attribute, inside which is the full date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
  If you need to get the day, month, year separately, then you can use the standard JS methods.
  Example: `new Date('2022-11-07').getDate()` will return `7`.
